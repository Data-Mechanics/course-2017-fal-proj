### Motivation

Boston is known accross the US as one of the biggest college towns in the country, but what effect does this have on the city itself? 
With over 150,000 students in the city of Boston alone, schools and their young populations are bound to have some impact on the 
surrounding area. With schools of various sizes spread all over Boston however, we are also interested in how each school's surroundings 
may affect their student population. To put ourselves in a position to be able to answer this question, we have decided to look 
at three categories of interest that can be rated and compared school to school: safety, social opportunity, and ease of tranportation. 
To do this we have used the data sets listed below, and performed transformations that make this data useful for analysis.
