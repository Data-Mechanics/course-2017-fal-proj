Find the most convenient living area in Boston

Boston, as one of the Boston metropolises of the United States, is very suitable for living in many aspects, including education, medical care, security, and transportaiton, etc. Therefore, investigating which area in boston is most convenient for living is very important. To evaluate whether a certain area is convenient for living, there are many complicated factors. In this project, we only consider four main factors including food, education, medical care, and crime rate. The data sets we are using to support this goal include Food Establishment Inspections, Crime Incident Report(August 2015-To Date), Colleges and Universities, Property Assessment 2017, and Hospital Locations. The way we want to implement these data sets is to display all locations in the map and then evaluate their conveniency score, display green if it is convenient for living, and red if it is not. If schools, hospitals, good restaurants are concentrated in a certain area and this area has low crime rate, we give such area a high score. If an area does not have many schools, hospital, good restaurants and has high crime rate, we give such area a low score.
