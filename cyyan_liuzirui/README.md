Find the most convenient living area in Boston

Boston, as one of the Boston metropolises of the United States, is especially famous for its education. There are lots of schools in Boston and a great number of students from all over the world. Therefore, how to provide good infrastructures and facilities for this students and how to ensure their safty becomes an important issue. To solve this issue, we should consider many aspects.

In this project, we only consider four main factors including trash receptacle locations, libraries, police stations, and hospitals. The data sets we are using to support this goal are the following:
1. Boston Public Schools (School Year 2012-2013) https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/492y-i77g.json
2. Boston Police District Station https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/pyxn-r3i2.json
3. Hospital Locations https://data.boston.gov/export/622/208/6222085d-ee88-45c6-ae40-0c7464620d64.json
4. Big Belly Locations https://data.boston.gov/export/15e/7fa/15e7fa44-b9a8-42da-82e1-304e43460095.json
5. Public Libraries http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cb00f9248aa6404ab741071ca3806c0e_6.json

The way we want to implement these data sets is to display all locations in the map and then evaluate the distance between schools and these infrastructures and facilities. If libraries, hospitals, police stations, and trash receptacles are concentrated in a certain area, we consider this area is suitable for building schools. If an area does not have many libraries, hospitals, police stations, and trash receptacles, we consider this kind of area is not suitable for building schools.
