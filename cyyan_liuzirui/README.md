Find the best real estate investment area in Boston

Boston, as one of the Boston metropolises of the United States, is very suitable for living in many aspects, including education, medical care, security, and transportaiton, etc. Therefore, an increasing number of people are eager to invest real estate in Boston. To evaluate whether a certain area is worth investing, there are many complicated factors. In this project, we only consider four main factors including garden locations, transportation, medical care, and crime rate. The data sets we are using to support this goal include Community Gardens, Crime Incident Report(August 2015-To Date), MBTA Bus Location Data, Property Assessment 2017, Hospital Locations. The way we want to implement these data sets is to display all locations in the map and then evaluate investment value, display green if it is good investments, and red if it is not so good. If a place is close to garden, hospital, bus stop and with low crime rate, we give such property a high score. If a place is far away from garden, hospital, bus stop and with high crime rate, we give such property a low score.
