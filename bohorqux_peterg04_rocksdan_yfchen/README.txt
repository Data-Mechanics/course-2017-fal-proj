Assignment: Project #3

*************************
Important Notes to Notice:
	- we are using Scipy for k-means: therefore the Scipy package must be installed on the system "pip install Scipy"
	- we are using GeoPy for our address conversion. If not already on the device, use "pip install geopy"
	- just a note in case the crimesProperty.py takes 10-15 seconds to start running even in trial - it is parsing through
		thousands of entries. it will be quick after that initial parsing
	- calculateCorrelations takes about 1 second per entry, it'll need to run 100 entries in trial mode, so that takes about 1.5 mins
*************************		

This is the final submission for our project #3 - a web service allowing users to see whether their
specified address is within the bounds of allowed happy hour restaurants.
