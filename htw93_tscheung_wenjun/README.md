## Project Narrative
Our project seeks to exlpore the relationship among shcool location, crime and hospitals in Boston and New York. We believe that there's some relationship like the number of crimes within one or two miles of the school.

As one of the most famous city all over the world,People travels to Boston a lot.People might use website like booking or tripdavisor to find out the suitable hotel from them. However, most of the grades and comment concentrates on the hotels themselve, like the quality of service, cleaness, etc. Obviously, those grades and comments ignore the surroundings, like crime rates, transportations. Hence we try to evaluate the hotels of Boston by some other factors, like crime ratw and transportation information.
