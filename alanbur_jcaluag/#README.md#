Boston roads and their problem areas

	Vision Zero is a safety concern application where citizens can enter complaints on road safety and road maintenance issues in Boston. The dataset provides the type of complaint, the date of the complaint, and the geographical coordinate of the problem area. With Vision Zero, we can locate the roads in Boston that require attention.

	The Vision Zero dataset was extracted, along with MBTA bus stations, traffic Signals, bike routes, and Hubway stations. All of these datasets contain geographical coordinates. With an overlay of all the datasets, we obtain a map through which we can learn more about the areas that have problems. Such a map provides a means of ranking the complaints based on priority. For example, a problem area that is near a bus station and many traffic signals would indicate a busy intersection. Government workers can then quickly identify the areas they want to allocate their time and resources to.
