This repository pertains to CS591 - Fall 2017 taught by Andrei lapets.
**This project description will be updated as we continue work on the infrastructure.**

## Data Sets:

1. #### getHealthInspections.py 
```
    Retrieves data about HealthInspections from data.boston.gov and deposits the data in an instance of MongoDB.
```
2. #### getObesityData.py 
```
    Retrieves 16000 data points regarding obesity statistics from the CDC website. This is then added to the instance of MongoDB for further manipulation downstream.
```
3. #### getOrganicPrices.py 
```
    Retrieves data of the average price for particular food items during the 12 months of the year. This data is not used downstream.
```
4. #### getPropertyValues.py 
```
    Retrieves data on different types of buildings/homes in boston as well as other descriptors of value from data.boston.gov. This data is used downstream for a correlation between obesitry and income.
```
5. #### getWinterMarkets.py
```
    Retrieves data on the location of seasonal markets in the boston area from data.cityofboston.gov. This data is deposited into the MongoDB instance and is used downstream to calculate the distance of optimal placements of markets based on obesity statistics.
```
6. #### getZipCodeData.py
```
    Retrieves a mapping object of the zipcodes in Boston to their respective districts and town names. This is used downstream as a metric of joining some datapoint fields based on ZipCodes.
```
7. #### setHealthPropertyZip
```
    Retrieves the data generated by getHealthInspections.py, getPropertyValues.py, and getZipCodeData.py and runs multiple aggregations, projections, selections, and transformations on the data to properly format the data to place back in mongoDB.
```
8. #### setObesityMarkets.py 
```
    Retrieves the data generated by getObesityData.py and getWinterMarkets and runs K means to determine the optimal location for Winter Health Markets.
```


## Instructions:
```

        - run "python3 execute.py biel_otis" to execute the code
        - The code may take up to 10 minutes to run and produce a provenance diagram
```
