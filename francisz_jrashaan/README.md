## Narrative 
We are looking to answer questions about crime and how it is correlated to various factors within the cities of Boston and Cambridge.  For example, the three transformations which we perform maps the correlation of homicides to the positioning of streetlights in the city, namely by finding intersections between the latitude and longitude of the homicides and the latitude and longitude of the streetlights within the city.  Other datasets we included deal with open spaces such as parks and other community spaces, land use, and population density within neighborhoods in Cambridge. Through the combination  of the various datasets from our three sources, we can answer several questions by observing the intersections and patters in our data.  Our transformations answer questions that helps our understanding of the way we look at homicides and their correlation to streetlights; this leads to improved police patrol routes, emergency box placements, response time, and other factors. The data we generated can be used by the city as an indicator of what streets need to be revamped in order to reduce crime.         The other datasets we extracted, but did not transform, can answer questions, if transformed in the future, about the correlation between open space, population density, and land use in Cambridge and Boston respectively, such as serving as an indicator for the areas that need to be improved economically by developing and repurposing areas of real estate throughout the city to reduce crime, and looking at the relationship between open space and land use.
