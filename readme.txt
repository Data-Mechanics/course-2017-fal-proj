Problem:
Expanding public transportation and car sharing are two of the most popular solutions to reduce emissions produced per individual. However, these options are not necessarily zero emission options and still pollute the enviornment. Therefore it's important that more effective measures be considered to reduce emissions for individual commutes to zero. The solutions we are considering are biking, and charging stations for electric cars which all contribute zero emissions assuming electricity powering them is also generated in a enviornmentally friendly way. Using Hubway data, bike network data, charging station data, and neighborhood data we will attempt to find the most optimal "green score" for each neighborhood within Boston. Our definition of a "green score" for a neighborhood will be the proximity and frequency of zero emission forms of transportation. Initially using various projection and selection transformations we will calculate the green scores for each neighborhood. Then we will use k-means to find more optimal placements of these zero emission forms of transportation. This will allow us to find the most optimal "green score" for each neighhorhood.
