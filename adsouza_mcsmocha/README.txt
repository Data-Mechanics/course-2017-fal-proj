Narrative:
In order to find a way to improve the efficiency of garbage collection throughout Boston, we have compiled several datasets to locate problematic areas that showed inefficient
garbage disposal trends. The datasets we have collected include: 311 Service Requests, Public Works Department (PWD), Crime Reports, Big Belly Alerts, and CityScore. We selected certain records from 311 Service Requests that pertained to trash and used them in all three of our transformations because they contained the neighborhoods and the corresponding violations. We used these violations in addition to the corresponding districts (matched by transforming PWD dataset), related crimes (matched by transforming Crime Reports and using the districts from PWD), Big Belly alerts (matched by transforming Big Belly Alerts dataset and coordinates from 311 Service Requests), and CityScore to potentially find a solution that maximizes the rate of garbage collection. With this data, one can possibly map out areas for potential improvements to the waste management infrastructure.
