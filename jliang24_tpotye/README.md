We are evaluating the quality of city services in comparison to the areas with high and low property values. The problem we are trying to discover is to see if there is a discrepancy in the services provided by Boston based on location value. We will be gathering the data for Property Assessments from 2016, Boston Police Stations, and Boston 311 Service requests from the City of Boston data portal. We will be gathering data for Pothole Repairs in Boston from the National League of Cities data portal. We will be gathering Hospital Location data from Analyze Boston data portal. We will use the Property Assessments in Boston to find the average property value per zip code. Then we will be using the Boston Police Station and Hospital Location data sets to determine how many exist within each zip code. We will then be gathering data from Boston 311 Service requests and Pothole Repairs to determine the ratio of repairs to requests per zip code.
