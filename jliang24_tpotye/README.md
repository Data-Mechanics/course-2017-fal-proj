Taylor Potye: tpotye Jennifer Liang: jliang24   We are going to use the
data sets to see if the hourly precipitation in Boston, New York City,
and Washington DC correlate with the frequency of taxi activity. Our
main question is whether or not taxi companies should deploy more
drivers on days that it forecasts rain and how many drivers they should
deploy. We will be getting the hourly precipitation data from National
Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA). Also we will be getting
the taxi data for each city provided by the city’s public data portal
(nyc.gov, data.cityofboston.gov, and open data.dc.gov). We will combine
the data by using the total precipitation for each day in December 2012
and comparing it to the taxi pick up date and time of the meter
engagement. We will also be looking at the frequency of taxi drivers
each day by using MapReduce to accumulate the number of daily active
taxis.
