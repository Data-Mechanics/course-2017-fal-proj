Question: Whatâ€™s the best location for a restaurant in Boston. 

Factors: 
1. Traffic: The number of T stops (red line) within 0.5 mi. If there is T stop nearby, it is easier to access the restaurant and the traffic expected to be higher, which can bring more walk-in business and customers from further part of the area.

2. Economics: The medium income in the neighborhood, which is sorted by zip code, ideally higher than $40,000 per year. Many local restaurants are mainly supported by people whom live in the neighborhood. If on average people are richer in the neighborhood, the chances they eat out will be higher, and the revenue per person will be higher since they are more willing to pay more for good food.

3. Traffic: The number of Hubway Bike station within 0.5 mi. The Hubway station, the bike renting station, can increase the accessibility of the restaurant, bringing more customers.

4. Permit: The number of restaurant permit within 1 mi. If there are many restaurants nearby, the traffic will be increased, which potentially could bring more business.

5. Safety: The number of crime happened in the neighborhood from 2012-2015. If it is a safer neighborhood, more customers are willing to return, and the risk of restaurant being stolen is lower.

6. Vendor: The number of vendors nearby. A higher number of vendors implies a good traffic and more business.

Algorithms for three non-trivial transformations

1. Selection: This algorithm filters out all the redline T stops that are not in Boston.
2. Intersection: This algorithm find the restaurants that are in a street that had crimes. 
3. Aggregation: This algorithm find the mean of the income of the population in a neighborhood.
